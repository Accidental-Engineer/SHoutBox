    <div id="body"><h2>About The Project</h2><br>
<p>This project is a simple real-time chat-box. It serves the general need of chatting with people of a specific group. It is easy-to-use. It is based on AJAX and jQuery.
</p><br>
<p>Basically, the present form of chat-box is available for the students of IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. They can register with their admission
number and email-id to join the chat going on. The best thing about this chat-box is that  it's interface is very simple and attractive.
 Besides that, there is no room for the
 ads which seem irritating to anybody. In near future, you will also be able to share pictures and videos in the chat-box.</p> <br>

<p>It has been developed through GitHub. And if someone is interested in designing, development and content management, he can contact the developers or he can look for <a href = "https://github.com/Accidental-Engineer">Accidental-Engineer</a> on GitHub.
